I misunderstood what the assignment wanted.
The "shared" aspect between the two elements
didn't refer to the fact that they were both 
buttons, but was referring to the class 
selectors I had just added to each...
My code worked. For the sake of getting used
to what the lesson is teaching me, I've
commented out my original work for preservation,
with the "correct" method of code underneath.

below - it rounded the button's corners  (for 
some reason), and nullified the color.
Remember to add commas!*/

This is the functional, but technically incorrect 
method for both buttons' shared traits:

button {

  font-family: Helvetica, "Times New Roman", sans-serif;
